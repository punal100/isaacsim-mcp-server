Fixes # (issue)

## Tested Isaac Sim Version(s)

<!--
List every Isaac Sim version you have tested this PR against.
Running unit tests alone is NOT sufficient — you must verify the behavior
inside a running Isaac Sim instance.

6.0 ships two physics backends and they are separate runtimes, not a detail:
a fault that appears on one and not the other is itself the finding. Tick the
one(s) you actually ran, and say which you did not — stating a gap is fine,
implying coverage you do not have is not.

Only one Isaac Sim instance can run per GPU, so these are sequential runs.

- [ ] Isaac Sim 6.0.x — Newton (`isaac-sim.newton.sh`)
