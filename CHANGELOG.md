## [Unreleased]

### Fixed / Changed — tool hardening for agent use
- step_simulation now fails loud on a running timeline and the debug loop is
  documented as step-only (never play while debugging). (#1)
- create_action_graph gains inline_script= one-step shortcut; the broken inline
  example is removed. (#2)
- reload_script recompiles Action-Graph ScriptNodes that reference the edited
  file, instead of silently no-oping. (#3)
- get_isaac_logs: eager listener, run-scoped (since_last_play default),
  non-destructive default, and captures print() as [PRINT]. (#4/#5)
- execute_script documents that it can silently disturb a live ScriptNode. (#6)
- create_object documents that scale= is a raw native-size multiplier. (#7)
- stop_simulation resets the scene to spawn state. (#8)

### Fixed — silent wrong answers found by live testing on 5.1.0 and 6.0.1

Each of these was reproduced against a running simulator, one version at a
time, and re-measured after the fix. Unit tests passed throughout: every one of
them needs a real stage, a real physics step or a real referenced asset to show
up at all.

- **Joint limits were reported in degrees while positions were radians.**
  `get_joint_config` returned USD's raw revolute limits: FR3 joint 1 read
  `[-157.2, 157.2]` next to `actual_position=0.5`, where the real limit is
  ±2.7437 rad. An agent clamping a target to those limits would command 25
  revolutions. Limits now arrive in the same units as positions, with an
  explicit `limit_units` per joint. Prismatic limits are deliberately untouched
  — USD stores those in stage units, and converting them turns a 0.04 m gripper
  stroke into 0.0007. `get_robot_info` previously advertised `"degrees"` for the
  same attributes and now agrees. Both adapters. (`adapters/units.py`)
- **A requested rotation compounded with the prim's existing orientation.**
  `set_prim_transform` only ever wrote `xformOp:rotateXYZ`, so on a prim
  carrying `xformOp:orient` the rotation was appended rather than replacing
  anything, landing after `xformOp:scale`. On a prim with orient=90° and
  scale=(1,2,1), asking for 45° produced 135° and a shear of 1.5. It already
  bit in practice: 5.1 cameras ship `orient=(0.5,0.5,-0.5,-0.5)`, so
  `create_camera(rotation=...)` could not aim a camera at all. Both adapters.
  (`adapters/transforms.py`)
- **`get_prim_info` had no rotation.** It returned position only, so "is this
  prim rotated?" was unanswerable through the tools while the docstring
  advertised the transform. It now reports rotation (XYZ degrees, the order
  `transform_object` accepts) and scale, read off the orthonormalized matrix so
  scale cannot corrupt the angle.
- **Environments lost their axis and unit conversion.** USD authors
  `unitsResolve` ops for a reference whose layer declares a different `upAxis`
  or `metersPerUnit` — but only when the target prim has no pre-existing
  children. `load_environment` referenced onto `/Environment`, which ships
  `defaultLight`, so the conversion was skipped: a ground standing on edge,
  10 km across, floor at z=-5000. That is 6 of 25 shipped environments on 5.1
  and 8 of 28 on 6.0 by up-axis, 8 and 10 by units. It now references onto
  `/Environment/<name>` and reports what USD applied under `corrections`, plus
  `bounds` with extent and floor height. Both adapters.
- **`clear_scene` did not clear a loaded environment**, so a later
  `create_physics_scene(floor=True)` stacked a second ground under the first.
  It now empties `/Environment` while always keeping `defaultLight` — an unlit
  stage renders black, which reads as a broken sensor — and takes
  `keep_environment` for callers who want to keep it. Reloading an environment
  now replaces rather than stacking references.
- **`stop_simulation` silently kept the stepped pose** when called promptly
  after `step_simulation`. `_arm_reset_point` queues play/pause to give PhysX a
  restore point, but timeline transitions are tick-driven, so the point landed
  after `step()` returned. Deterministic on 6.0.1: a cube stepped from z=2.0
  stayed at z=-3.32 through stop. Arming now pumps once so the transition lands.
  The stepped result stays bit-identical. V6 only — V5 never had it. (#8 above
  covers the reset itself.)
- **`get_simulation_state` reported a Python repr as the version.** On 6.0
  `get_version()` returns an 8-tuple, not a string, so clients saw
  `"('6.0.1', 'rc.7', '6', ...)"` instead of `6.0.1-rc.7`. The same wrong
  assumption made adapter selection load V5 on a 6.0 runtime; that half had been
  fixed, this half had not. Both now read the duality from one place.
  (`adapters/version.py`) V6 only.
- **Both lidar tools were dead on 5.1.** `create_lidar` raised
  `got multiple values for keyword argument 'config'` (5.1's `LidarRtx` takes
  `config_file_name`), and `get_lidar_point_cloud` raised
  `'LidarRtx' object has no attribute 'get_point_cloud'` (5.1 exposes annotators
  plus `get_current_frame()`). The annotator must be attached *before*
  `initialize()` and the wrapper must be cached, exactly as cameras already are.
  V5 only — 6.0's lidar path was fixed earlier and left 5.1 behind.
- **Commands sent during startup failed with a raw AttributeError.** The socket
  accepts connections several seconds before Kit has a stage — measured on
  6.0.1 at t+6.8s versus t+14.5s, and an MCP client normally connects the moment
  the port opens. Every stage-dependent tool in that window returned
  `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'GetPrimAtPath'`, which reads as a broken
  server rather than one still starting. Dispatch now detects the pending stage
  and returns a message saying to retry. Both adapters.
- **Cameras could not be deleted.** `delete_object` on a camera returned
  success and the prim was still there a tick later, surviving `clear_scene`
  too, because an initialized Camera wrapper owns a render product, annotators
  and event subscriptions that keep its prim alive — dropping the cache entry is
  not enough, the wrapper has to be destroyed. Adapters now release the sensor
  before deleting, which also frees the render product that otherwise keeps
  rendering for the life of the Kit process. Measured on 5.1.0: camera prims
  1 -> 0 and render products 2 -> 1 on delete, where both previously stayed put.
  6.0 is unfixed — see known issues.
- **`apply_material` leaked a raw USD C++ error** naming NVIDIA's build tree
  when a path did not exist. It validates both prims and names the offending
  one. Both adapters.

### Changed
- `scripts/smoke_test_v6.py` is now `scripts/smoke_test.py` and runs against
  either runtime, detecting the adapter from `simulation.get_state` and
  asserting what is true for each — V5 must *not* grow the V6-only reporting
  fields, so a misdetected adapter fails the run instead of passing quietly.
  Several of its checks had encoded contracts the code deliberately no longer
  has, or never had: two did `play` → `step` after that was made an error, and
  the reset check read a top-level `position` from `get_prim_info`, which has
  always nested it under `transform`.
- `clear_scene` gains `keep_environment`; `load_environment` returns
  `corrections` and `bounds`, and its `prim_path` now defaults to a named child
  of `/Environment` — read it from the response rather than assuming it.

### Known issues
- `get_lidar_point_cloud` returns `point_count` without the points themselves on
  6.0; the decoded cloud is discarded by the handler.
- Camera deletion is fixed on 5.1 but **not on 6.0**, and cannot be fixed at
  this layer. `create_camera` builds an `RtxCamera`, and that class exposes no
  teardown at all — only `reset_to_default_state`, `reset_xform_op_properties`
  and `valid` — while Isaac holds the instance internally, so nothing can
  release it. It re-creates the camera prim on the tick after a delete: the prim
  is genuinely gone in the same tick, then reappears at the end of the parent's
  children with its render product still targeting it
  (`HydraTextures/camera_sensor_NNN -> camera: ['/World/C1']`). `delete_object`
  now verifies the prim went and reports failure when it did not, but a handler
  cannot wait a tick, so the reappearing case still slips through. Reuse a
  camera rather than deleting it on 6.0.
- On 5.1, `clear_scene` with several cameras alive still removes only one per
  pass, and Kit logs `SDGPipeline/Replicator_NN_Reference` attribute errors, so
  destroying a sensor appears to need a tick before its prim can go. A repeated
  `clear_scene` drains the rest.
- `create_camera` has no look-at parameter, so aiming requires computing euler
  angles by hand.
- Only one Isaac Sim instance can run at a time on a single GPU; a second
  concurrent instance caused device-lost crashes during testing.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Isaac Sim 6.0.0 support** — new `IsaacAdapterV6` built on `isaacsim.core.experimental.*` + `SimulationManager` + `isaacsim.sensors.experimental.rtx` + `isaacsim.asset.importer.urdf.URDFImporter`. Works under both the PhysX launcher (`isaac-sim.sh`) and the Newton launcher (`isaac-sim.newton.sh`).
- **Engine auto-detection** — `adapters/__init__.py:get_adapter()` reads `isaacsim.core.version.get_version()` and selects V5 or V6 by major version. V6 reads `SimulationManager.get_active_physics_engine()` at construction time.
- **`engine` and `isaacsim_version` fields on `get_simulation_state`** — MCP clients can see the active backend without poking at the runtime.

### Changed
- V6 URDF import uses `URDFImporter(URDFImporterConfig(...))` instead of the deprecated `URDFCreateImportConfig`/`URDFParseFile`/`URDFImportRobot` kit commands.
- V6 physics state reads route through `SimulationManager.get_physics_simulation_view()` (the `omni.physics.tensors` view), replacing the V5 direct call to `omni.physx.get_physx_interface().get_rigidbody_transformation()` (which is unavailable under the Newton kit).
- V6 sensor methods use `isaacsim.sensors.experimental.rtx.{RtxCamera,CameraSensor,Lidar,LidarSensor}` instead of the deprecated `isaacsim.sensors.camera.Camera` / `isaacsim.sensors.rtx.LidarRtx`.

### Notes
- 5.1.0 behavior unchanged — `IsaacAdapterV5` is untouched.
- Hot-reload script (`scripts/dev_mcp_server.sh`) now reloads `adapters.v6` alongside `adapters.v5`.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- Code style: apply ruff formatting to v5 adapter, graphs handler, and scene handler

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **`edit_action_graph` tool**: Modify attribute values and add connections on existing Action Graphs. Uses `og.Controller.set()` for ScriptNode `usePath`/`scriptPath` attributes (matching the pattern from `omni.graph.scriptnode` official tests). Auto-resets `state:omni_initialized` when script content or path changes to force ScriptNode reload
- **`script_file` parameter on `create_action_graph`**: One-step convenience for the common OnPlaybackTick → ScriptNode workflow. Automatically creates nodes, wires connections, and attaches the script file — replaces the previous two-step create + edit pattern
- **`prim_path` parameter on `create_robot`**: Explicit USD prim path control (e.g. `/World/Franka`) instead of name-based path derivation. Solves the common issue where robots are created at `/{Name}` but scripts expect `/World/{Name}`
- ScriptNode workflow documentation in MCP server instructions covering one-step (`script_file`) and two-step (`create` + `edit`) patterns, script reload via `edit_action_graph`, and `setup(db)`/`compute(db)` function requirements

### Changed
- `create_action_graph` docstring updated with `script_file` example and inline/file-based usage patterns
- `create_robot` docstring updated with `prim_path` parameter documentation
- Tool count updated to 42 across 9 categories

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **`create_action_graph` tool**: Build OmniGraph Action Graphs programmatically (nodes, connections, attribute values) via `og.Controller.edit()` — no more raw `execute_script` calls for OnPlaybackTick → ScriptNode wiring
- **Drive config warnings**: `get_joint_config` and `create_robot` now return a `warnings` array when any joint has `stiffness=0` and `damping=0` (e.g. FR3 `finger_joint2` broken drive)
- **Dimensional data in responses**: `create_object` now returns `actual_size` [x, y, z] in meters and `bounding_box` (min/max world-space corners)
- **Prim size inspection**: `get_prim_info` returns `actual_size` for geometric prims (Cube, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone, Capsule)
- **Inline joint info**: `create_robot` now returns `joint_names` and `num_dof` in the response, eliminating the need for a follow-up `get_robot_info` call
- **Joint limits**: `get_robot_info` now returns `joint_limits` with type (revolute/prismatic), lower/upper limits, and units per joint
- **Comprehensive server instructions**: MCP `instructions` field now includes workflow guidance for scene setup, debug loop (step-and-observe), controller development, and tool priority
- `get_prim_actual_size` adapter method for computing prim dimensions from USD geometry attributes and scale

### Changed
- **Tool docstrings rewritten** with workflow guidance:
  - `step_simulation` promoted as the primary debug tool with typical debug loop example
  - `execute_script` reframed as escape hatch with explicit list of preferred alternatives
  - `reload_script` positioned as the controller loading workflow
  - `get_joint_config`, `get_physics_state`, `get_isaac_logs` marked as diagnostic tools with when-to-call guidance
  - `set_joint_positions`, `get_joint_positions` now document units (radians/meters)
  - `create_object` documents default primitive sizes and scale behavior
- Replaced `asset_creation_strategy` prompt with inline `instructions` covering MCP vs Script/Action Graph scope
- Updated package name and version in extension.toml
- Added new application icon and social badge image

### Fixed
- **Ground plane collision**: `create_physics_scene` now applies `UsdPhysics.CollisionAPI` to the ground plane — objects no longer fall through the floor
- **Stale `.pyc` in `reload_script`**: Dev script now clears bytecode cache before `importlib.reload()` for both extension and user modules, preventing stale code from loading
- **Orphaned subscriptions**: `reload_script` exec() mode now cleans up subscriptions from previous runs before re-executing
- Dev hot-reload script: bypass pybind11 `__setattr__` on `omni.ext.IExt` subclasses using `__dict__` assignment
- Dev hot-reload script: use `isinstance(obj, MCPExtension)` instead of fragile `hasattr` checks that matched wrong objects
- Dev hot-reload script: clear stale `.pyc` files before `importlib.reload()` to ensure fresh source is loaded
- Use `Usd.TimeCode.Default()` instead of non-existent `Gf.TimeCode(0)` in `get_prim_actual_size`
- World-space (not local-space) transform for bounding box computation
- Cylinder/Cone axis attribute respected when computing dimensions
